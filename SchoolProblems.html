        <h1>School Problems</h1>
        <p>So here we will be talking about things that bother most people in school and how to handle them!</p>
   
 <p>First of all the one that we dislike the most HOMEWORK.
        All our teachers always have given us time to work on our homework so thats helpful. To help you study easier here is our top six personal studying tips!
        1.Have a clean and organized environment to study in.
        2.Don't be distracted like listening to music unless they       
          help you focus more.<br />
        3.Don't work on everything at once, start only one a time    
         ,it will help you focus more. <br />
        4.Do not eat or drink too much otherwise you'll find 
          yourself going to the washroom very often.<br />
        5.When studying takes breaks once in a while because YOU   
          NEED REST.<br />
        6.Try every once in a while to go over it and memorize little by little.<br />
